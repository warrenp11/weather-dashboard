# Weather Dashboard

## Introduction
This weather dashboard was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. I was required to create a dynamic weather forecast dashboard using third-party APIs which met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below). 

This application was written from scratch, no base code was provided.

## Description
A user can search for a city and then will be shown that city's current weather (with additional information) as well as a 5-day forecast. Recent searches will be saved and can be clicked to return to that city's weather forecast.

## Instructions
Enter a city in the search bar (on left side of page) to receive that day's forecast as well as a 5-day forecast.

## Installation
No installation required.

## Features
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Project Insight
This project is not 100% complete but it is functional (mostly). I intend to revist this project and make improvements-- time permitting.
